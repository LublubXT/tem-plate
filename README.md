# Tem Plate

**What is Tem Plate?** Tem Plate is a collection of free open-source hand-crafted web layouts, components, and templates built with tailwind css and more. All the components, layouts, and templates are fully responsive.

**Why use Tem Plate?** Tem Plate was built to make building website layouts fast and easy. It is loaded with many layouts and components. I am constantly adding more layouts and components for you guys to use in your projects.

You can check out all the layouts, components, and more [here](https://tem-plate.netlify.app/).

#### If you want me to add a specific layout or component, please let me know in the Discussions. Send me a picture of your design, and I will add that layout as soon as possible. I am constantly trying to add new layouts and components, and you guys can help with that.
